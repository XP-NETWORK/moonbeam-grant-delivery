# Moonbeam Grant Delivery Report

## `Milestone 1` — Smart Contract Development

| Specification |
|-|
| 0. Researched about Moonbeam [NFT token standards](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/build/eth-api/dev-env/openzeppelin/contracts/#deploying-an-erc-721-token) and other factors & protocols that distinguish it from other chains<br/>We have developed smart contracts that can:<br/>1. Support Singe & Batch transfers - ([ERC-721/ERC-1155](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/blob/f474704150da557f931e011026d0c033b391bd7a/dist/Minter.d.ts))<br/>2. [Freeze](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=freeze)/[Unfreeze](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=unfreeze) Native NFTs<br/>3. [Mint](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=mint)/[Burn](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=burn) wrapped NFTs<br/>4. [Withdraw](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=withdraw) the TX fees on the target chain in native tokens<br>5. Trust the [multisig](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/frost-secp256k1) of the bridge oracle validators<br/>6. [Whitelist](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=whitelist) NFT smart contracts<br/>7. [Pause](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=pause)/[Unpause](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=unpause) for maintenance or if compromised<br/>10. [Add / Remove](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=validate) validator<br/>11. Set consensus [threshold](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=threshold)|


## `Milestone 2` — Testing & Documenting

| Length | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 1 week | Tests & Documentation | 1. We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that can interact with the deployed smart contracts and backend service.<br/>2. The code will have proper unit-test coverage 85% to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests preparing for auditing<br/>3. [Deploying and testing](#deployment--testing-smart-contracts) the contracts in the testnet environment|

### Deployment & Testing Smart contracts:

#### The bridge smart contract have been deployed on Moonbeam Alpha

#### Moonbeam has been added to the testnet bridge UI

#### Transaction fee estimation

The destination TX fee is estimated in native tokens on Moonbeam after at least one NFT has been selected.

#### Approving

To make the bridge contract the operator of the NFT the Owner of the asset has to approve it in the smart contract holding the ledger of this token.

![Signing the Approve TX in Metamask for Moonbeam Alpha](./assets/4.png)

Had the transaction been successful, the indicator to the right from the `Approve selcted NFTs` is set to `true`.

![5](./assets/5.png)


#### Transferring

After the destination address is set and the Approval is set to true, the `Send` button becomes active.

![Sending NFTs from Moonbeam](assets/6.png)

The fee is comprised of two parts:

1. The native chain fee to award the validators (for example, 0.00024068 DEV)
2. The destination TX fee charged by the bridge in the native tokens (2.286 DEV)

#### Seeing the result

The transaction hashes at the bottom of the `Bridging results` screen are clickable links that take the user to the explorer of the relevant chain.

![Results screen](./assets/8.png)

The transaction hash from the examle transaction is the following: https://moonbase.moonscan.io/tx/0xe516a5f70643125bc485d033fe937cafcede70f1be7a18817ec4b406843327c5

#### Checking the result in the Bridge UI

The NFT card displaying the transferred NFT is gone after the transfer, indicating that the `NFT-Indexer` works correctly.
