## `Milestone 1` — Smart Contract Development

| Specification |
|-|
| 0. Researched about Moonbeam [NFT token standards](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/build/eth-api/dev-env/openzeppelin/contracts/#deploying-an-erc-721-token) and other factors & protocols that distinguish it from other chains<br/>We have developed smart contracts that can:<br/>1. Support Singe & Batch transfers - ([ERC-721/ERC-1155](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/blob/f474704150da557f931e011026d0c033b391bd7a/dist/Minter.d.ts))<br/>2. [Freeze](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=freeze)/[Unfreeze](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=unfreeze) Native NFTs<br/>3. [Mint](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=mint)/[Burn](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=burn) wrapped NFTs<br/>4. [Withdraw](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=withdraw) the TX fees on the target chain in native tokens<br>5. Trust the [multisig](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/frost-secp256k1) of the bridge oracle validators<br/>6. [Whitelist](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=whitelist) NFT smart contracts<br/>7. [Pause](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=pause)/[Unpause](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=unpause) for maintenance or if compromised<br/>10. [Add / Remove](https://github.com/XP-NETWORK/XP.network-HECO-Migration/search?q=validate) validator<br/>11.

## `Milestone 2` — Testing & Documenting

| Length | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 1 week | Tests & Documentation | 1. We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that can interact with the deployed smart contracts and backend service.<br/>2. The code will have proper unit-test coverage 85% to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests preparing for auditing<br/>3. [Deploying and testing](#deployment--testing-smart-contracts) the contracts in the testnet environment|
